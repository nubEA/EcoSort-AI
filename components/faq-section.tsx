      question: "What is WasteNet AI exactly?",
      answer:
        "WasteNet AI is a machine learning platform that uses computer vision to automatically identify and classify different types of waste. It's designed to be integrated into sorting facilities, smart bins, and recycling plants to improve sorting accuracy and provide valuable data analytics.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of waste can the model identify?",
      answer:
        "Our model is trained on a vast database and can identify a wide range of categories, including but not limited to: PET, HDPE, cardboard, glass (clear, brown, green), various metals, and common organic waste. The model can also be custom-trained to recognize specific items unique to your waste stream.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does this integrate with our existing hardware?",
      answer:
        "We provide a flexible API that can be integrated with your existing systems. It's designed to work with standard industrial cameras mounted over conveyor belts or inside smart bins. Our system sends classification data to your controllers (PLCs) in real-time to trigger sorting mechanisms like air jets or robotic arms.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the classification?",
      answer:
        "Our models typically achieve over 95% accuracy on common waste types. The system also includes a continuous learning loop. Any items that are difficult to classify can be flagged for review, and this new data is used to retrain and improve the model's performance over time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of analytics does the platform provide?",
      answer:
        "Our dashboard gives you a real-time and historical view of your waste stream composition. You can track key metrics like the volume of each waste type, contamination rates, and diversion rates. This data is crucial for optimizing operations, ensuring compliance, and generating accurate ESG reports.",
